# I: Gadget Collections

The engineers at the High Stakes Pocket-filler Coalition need your help to
develop the most effective collection of gadgets out of their vast collection.
Unfortunately, each spy's pockets are only so big, and the gadgets take up
different amounts of room. You are tasked to find the number of different ways
the agents can fill their pockets with gadgets. Agents may hold multiple of the
same gadget at the same time.

## Input

The first line of the input data is the number of test cases, $m$. Each test
case starts with a new line which is size of the agent's pocket, $s$, which is
in the range of 250 to 400, inclusive. The next line is the number of unique
gadgets in the collection, $n$, which is in the range 8 to 13, inclusive. The
next $n$ lines are the sizes of each gadget in the collection. The sizes are
given in a random order.

## Output

Your output should be one line, for each test case, which contains the number
of possible combinations that can fill the pocket. Each gadget may be used
multiple times.
